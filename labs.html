<h1>Lab Information</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
This class will use two different types of labs: Open and Closed. During the lecture portion of this class, you will learn the basics of computer architecture
theory and design. In lab, you will demonstrate knowledge and gain experience in the actual development of a relatively simple computer (RSC) architecture.
Using the software package Logisim-evolution, you will design, construct, and demonstrate circuits throughout the semester.
There will normally be a Closed Lab each week which will be performed within the computer lab and under strict time limits.
Open Labs will be assigned during this time as well and should be constructed/completed outside of lab time during the following week.<br/><br/>

<h2>Class Flow</h2>
You will be introduced to the theory needed to perform Open/Closed Lab projects usually during the preceding lecture time.
Your lab assistant will introduce Open/Closed Lab projects and make initial, very important announcements at the beginning of the lab session.
Therefore, make sure that your attendance for the lab is prompt. The lab assistant will normally have your previous lab graded by the next lab period.
After graded labs are returned, the lab assistant will be available for questions regarding the current assignment.
PLEASE ASK QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE THEM! <i>The lab assistant cannot know if there is an issue with the lab unless s/he receives questions regarding that issue.
</i> The lab assistant can answer questions pertaining to the use of the software and the theory behind the lab.
 <i>THE LAB ASSISTANT WILL NOT GIVE DIRECT ANSWERS TO THE LABS</i>.<br/>
Some labs, both Open and Closed, are accessory labs that cover an important component of theory, but the LARGE MAJORITY of the labs depend
on each other and are pieces for the FINAL PROJECT (RSC). The FINAL PROJECT will require you to construct the computer that you have designed and
built throughout the semester. Therefore, it is of UTMOST IMPORTANCE that you complete each lab and do each lab correctly.<br/><br/>

<h2>Lab Submissions</h2>
All lab assignments should be submitted to the coursework website in D2L, as described in the class sylabus.
 <!-- If a lab assignment is submitted multiple times, <i>the lab with the most recent submission date will be graded</i>.  -->
 Closed Labs are due by the end of the closed lab session for that day. Open Labs are due by the date and time given for that particular lab assignment
 (typically, by the end of the closed lab for the following week). All submissions are to be zipped (.zip file archive).
 <!-- The zip file is to be named <span style="font-weight: bold;">FirstnameLastname_LabID.zip</span>.
 (ex: IvanSyzonenko_OLA5.zip for open lab 5 - IvanSyzonenko_CLA5.zip for closed lab 5) --><br/>
Label <b>all</b> of your circuits <b>and</b> any associated files in the upper left corner with:<br /><br/>
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">Your Name</span><br style="font-family: courier new,courier;" />
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">Lab #</span><br style="font-family: courier new,courier;" />
 <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">Circuit Name </span><br/><br/>

<h2>Late Lab Submissions</h2>
Labs, both Open and Closed, will not be accepted late (but please refer to the lab resubmission policy below).
All assignments are due on the date that is specifically set. Extensions will only be given for extenuating circumstances and only with
<i>prior approval</i> of the lab assistant or Dr. Sainju.<br/><br/>

<h2>Attendance</h2>
 Attendance of Closed Lab is <u>mandatory</u>. <br/>
 Non-attendance of a lab will result in a grade of 0 unless special arrangements have been made prior to the lab.
 Most of the labs are related to building the RSC, therefore any student who misses a lab, with or without prior approval,
 must make up the work in order to finish the final project.
  <!-- The labs are changed on occasion as minor corrections or adjustments are made. Therefore, having taken CSCI 3130 in a prior semester does not relieve students from attending lab. Tardiness may result in a reduced grade for the closed lab. -->
<br/>
<br/>

<span class="anchor" id="grading"></span>
<h1>Performance Evaluation</h1>
There will be approximately 7 Closed Lab assignments, 6 Open Lab assignments, and a Final Project (RSC).
The following explains how much each lab assignment is worth:<br/>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th scope="col">Closed Labs</td>
  <th scope="col">Open Labs</td>
  <th scope="col">Final Project (RSC)</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>10 points each</td>
  <td>20 points each</td>
  <td>100 points</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Grading Principles</h2>
All labs will be graded on correctness and adherence to the lab specifications below. Closed Lab assignments are due by the end of the assigned lab session,
and Open Lab assignments are due by the end of the subsequent lab session (unless the lab specifically states otherwise).
 <b>Late work will NOT be accepted unless explicit permissions have been given to you by the lab assistant and Dr. Sainju.</b>
 However, all labs should be (re)submitted to determine correctness since the FINAL PROJECT requires that all previous labs have been completed.<br/>

<ol>
<li>Grades for lab assignments will be recorded on D2L, and feedback on lab assignments will be provided via the D2L assignment submission system.
  Students should always check grades and download relevant feedback from the assignment submission system <b>before</b> lab time.
  If no errors were found with the circuit(s), you will receive simple feedback indicating the circuit tested properly and a final grade.
 Additionally, a grade of zero (0) will be assigned until all errors are corrected so that a final point value can be determined (see item 2 below).</li>
<li>The labs, both Open and Closed, differ significantly from the labs of other classes. Unlike most other classes, the Open and Closed labs in 3130,
  excluding a few, build upon one another to produce the Relatively Simple Computer (RSC). Therefore, it is critical that any and all errors be corrected for
  these assignments. If a submitted lab assignment is found to contain any errors during grading, then <i>until all errors are corrected</i>
   the recorded grade for the lab will remain a zero (0). All such labs will need to be corrected and resubmitted in a timely manner if errors are
   found during grading. Following grading of labs, the course submission system allows for resubmissions before the end of the subsequent lab session.</li>
<li>Labs submitted by their initial deadlines and containing no errors will receive 100% credit.
  Max credit you can receive is 90% for the first resubmission (within 1 week of the initial deadline), and 80% for the second resubmission
   (within 2 weeks of the initial deadline).
    Therefore, <i>a potential maximum of two resubmissions are allowed.</i>
    After this time, a grade of zero will be given. Additionally, no resubmissions will be accepted after Study Day (the last day before final exams). </li>
<li>Assignments are broken up into sections depending on the amount of effort required to complete the assignment. Remember, regardless of error severity,
  incorrect lab submissions will be returned with a grade of zero (see item 2 above). Penalties for incorrect lab submissions will normally be determined as follows:
<ul>
  <li>-10% Minor issues: simple errors and quick fixes that need attention</li>
  <li>-20% Medium issues: file naming and sub-directory issues, well hidden crossed wire, missing inputs/outputs, etc.</li>
  <li>-30% Major theory malpractice: bit-width mismatches (8 bits become 12 bits), incorrect part use, very poor design and mass deviation from instructions</li>
  <li>-50% Critical negligence: plainly obvious errors, mass wire crossing, anything that should have been obvious with quick error checking</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since most labs are related to the RSC, all students must correct errors on lab assignments in order to complete the final project (see item 2 above).
<b>NOTE: </b>Failure to correct errors in previous labs WILL have a direct impact on the final project. <b>Assistance on the final project may be withheld until
all previous labs are corrected. </b></li>
<li>All lab grades will be recorded on D2L (https://elearn.mtsu.edu).</li>
<li>Because the FINAL PROJECT requires the completion of all previous labs, it is strongly suggested that you maintain back-up copies of all of your work,
  preferably on a network/cloud drive.</li>
  <li>Please email Dr. Sainju (arpan.sainju@mtsu.edu) by January 24 at midnight with the subject "Spring 2023 CSCI3130 Extra Credit" acknowledging that you have read all the content of the syllabus to receive 5 points extra credit on your first exam.</li>
