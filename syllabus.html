   AzureAD will be accessible remotely from any computer with a web browser (suggested: Chrome or Firefox) at <a href="https://jupyterhub.cs.mtsu.edu/azuread/">https://jupyterhub.cs.mtsu.edu/azuread/</a>. If you access JupyterHub using a public computer, be sure to <b>log out</b> (not just close your browser) to protect your data.
  We will be using Logisim-evolution (a hardware simulator program) in the lab. You will need an external
  storage medium in order to retain assignments (e.g. A USB flash drive, Google Drive, or Dropbox are
  options to consider.) You may also wish to use Logisim on your home computer once assignments are
  given. Logisim-evolution is free and can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/">https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/</a>.
  <!-- If you do not have the ability or desire to download Logisim to your computer, you may 	access the software remotely via Remote Desktop to dozer.cs.mtsu.edu (use your CS account credentials).<br/> -->
  <!-- You will need a desktop or laptop computer with a fully-functioning camera and microphone for all Zoom sessions and online examinations. -->

  <!-- Incomplete grades are given rarely and only in extenuating circumstances. Page 56 of the <a href="http://catalog.mtsu.edu/">MTSU Undergraduate Catalog</a> states: "The grade I indicates that the student has not completed all course requirements because of illness or other uncontrollable circumstances, especially those which occur toward the end of the term. Mere failure to make up work or turn in required work on time does not provide the basis for the grade of "I" unless extenuating circumstances noted above are present for reasons acceptable to the instructor." Please refer to the <a href="http://catalog.mtsu.edu/">Undergraduate Catalog</a> for the complete Incomplete Grade Policy. -->

  <b>Attendance:</b> Students should not attend an on-ground, in-person class if they are
  ill, have any symptoms listed in the Pre-Class COVID-19 Self-Assessment, have
  tested positive for COVID-19, or have been in close contact with others who have
  tested positive. If they have tested positive or have been in close contact with
  someone who has, they should self-quarantine. Students are expected to keep
  their instructors informed regarding their status when they are absent from class
  and act with good faith and honesty when determining whether or not they
  attend class. For more information, see
  <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/policies/academic-affairs-students/311-A.php">https://www.mtsu.edu/policies/academic-affairs-students/311-A.php</a> and your
  instructorâ€™s syllabus.<br/>
  <b>Masking:</b> All students, faculty, and staff must be masked and observe appropriate
  six-foot minimum social distancing while on campus. Masks are defined as
  disposable single-use paper masks, cloth face coverings with ear loops or ties,
  balaclavas, gaiters, and bandanas that cover the nose and mouth. Students who
  cannot wear a mask for medical reasons must have a written accommodation
  from the Disability and Access Center (<a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/dac/index.php">https://www.mtsu.edu/dac/index.php</a>).<br/>
  For additional guidance on MTSU rules, facilities, and schedules, see
  <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/coronavirus/index.php">https://www.mtsu.edu/coronavirus/index.php</a>.<br/>
  <br/> -->

  <h2>Financial Aid Notice</h2>
  Students receiving any form of financial aid should always consult the Financial Aid Office before dropping a course.  For additional information, contact the Financial Aid Office (898-2830) or see <a href="http://www.mtsu.edu/financialaid">http://www.mtsu.edu/financialaid</a>.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h3>Hope (Lottery) Scholarship Information</h3>
  Do you have a lottery scholarship?  To retain the Tennessee Education Lottery Scholarship eligibility, you must earn a cumulative TELS GPA of 2.75 after 24 and 48 attempted hours and a cumulative TELS GPA of 3.0 thereafter.  A grade of C, D, F, FA, or I in this class may negatively impact TELS eligibility.<br/><br/>
  If you drop this class, withdraw, or if you stop attending this class you may lose eligibility for your lottery scholarship, and you may not be able to regain eligibility at a later time.<br/><br/>
  For additional Lottery rules, please refer to your Lottery Statement of Understanding form (<a href="http://www.mtsu.edu/financial-aid/forms/LOTFEV.pdf">http://www.mtsu.edu/financial-aid/forms/LOTFEV.pdf</a>) or contact your MT One Stop Enrollment Counselor (<a href="http://www.mtsu.edu/one-stop/counselor.php">http://www.mtsu.edu/one-stop/counselor.php</a>).<br/><br/>

  <br/><br/>
  <h2>Reporting of Unofficial Withdrawals</h2>
  Federal regulations require that students who cease class attendance but do not officially withdraw from the University must be reported so that future financial aid will cease and/or the student will be required to return funds. Therefore, during the term I will be required to complete a roster indicating those students who have stopped attending class without officially withdrawing. Faculty members are not required to check attendance each day; however, I may use project submission deadlines, exams, quizzes, advising appointments, or other methods I choose to determine unofficial withdraws.
  <br/><br/>
  <h2>Reasonable Accommodation for Students with Disabilities</h2>
  Middle Tennessee State University is committed to campus access in accordance with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
